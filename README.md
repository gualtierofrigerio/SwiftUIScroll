# SwiftUIScroll

See my blog post https://www.gfrigerio.com/lazy-loading-in-swiftui/

I added pull down to refresh as discussed here https://www.gfrigerio.com/pull-down-to-refresh-in-swiftui/

Blog post about refreshable https://www.gfrigerio.com/refresh-swiftui-views/

If you want to use the refreshable scroll view in your project you can add it via SPM by adding this repo https://github.com/gualtierofrigerio/GFRefreshableScrollView
